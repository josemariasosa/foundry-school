# Learning Foundry ðŸ˜›

## Running a local node:

```sh
anvil
```

## Creating / Importing a new account for testing

```sh
cast wallet import quietRat --interactive
```

After typing the private key, and a password to encrypt it, a new account will be created in the `~/.foundry/keystores/` directory under the name `quietRat`.

## Deploy a contract into the anvil node

```sh
# Dry run ðŸŒµ
forge create Counter --account quietRat

# Deploy to local node
forge create Counter --account quietRat --broadcast
```

Deploy using a script. This script runs only on a simulated one-time chain, after the script ends the simulation stops and the deployment is not persistent.

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol --broadcast
```

If you want to point to an specific chain, even if it's our local anvil chain, you need to declare an RPC URL.

```sh
forge script script/Counter.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url 127.0.0.1:8545 --account quietRat
```
